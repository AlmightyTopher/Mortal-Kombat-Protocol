# Mortal Kombat Protocol ü•ã
A self-auditing MCP finisher agent that enforces completion with Mortal Kombat flair.

## Overview
The Mortal Kombat Protocol (MKP) is a reusable automation spec kit and Finisher Agent designed to keep AI-driven projects from dying half-built.  
It audits structure, verifies MCP setup, and‚Äîwhen everything checks out‚Äîdeclares a **Flawless Victory**.

## Commands
```bash
/finish_him audit
/finish_him finalize
````

* **audit** ‚Äì Checks project readiness and manifest compliance.
* **finalize** ‚Äì Runs all validation, starts MCPs, then ends with appropriate Mortal Kombat dramatics.

```

## Quick Start

```

If everything‚Äôs configured correctly, you‚Äôll hear a short 8-bit fanfare and see:

```
Flawless Victory.
```
